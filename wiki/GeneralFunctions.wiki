= Functions that must be implemented by the programmer =

_None._

= Functions that are provided by the EDK =

=== void emu_init(const char* name, int argc, char** argv) ===

This function initializes the EDK system. It must be the first function to be called from the [EmulatorFile emulator file]. The argument *name* provides the name that'll appear as the title of the main window. The arguments *argc* and *argv* are those passed by the main function.

Example:
{{{
int main(int argv, char* argc)
{
    emu_init("IBM PC", argc, argv);
    return 0;
}
}}}
