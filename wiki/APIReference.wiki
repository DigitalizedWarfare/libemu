This is a reference page. If you never wrote a emulator before, you probably need to read the [ComputerTutorial Computer Tutorial] page. If you already wrote a emulator and want to write your first emulator, check the [EmulatorTutoral Emulator Tutorial].

The [AtariTutorial Atari Tutorial] describes the process of writing a real machine emulator.

= Philosophy =

The EDK work philosophy is described in the [Philosophy] page. Its understanding is essential for writing a emulator.

= Tools =

EDK is made of 5 different tools. Check the [Tools] page to understand what they do.

= Function Prefixes =

All functions in the API begin with `emu_` or `dev_`. In fact, they are the same functions; the only difference is that when they're called from the emulator, they should be called with the `emu_` prefix. If they are called from one of the devices, they sould be called with the `dev_` prefix.

You don't need to understand why is that, but if you must, you can read [WhyEmuDev here].
