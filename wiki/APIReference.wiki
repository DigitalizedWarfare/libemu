This is a reference page. If you never wrote a emulator before, you probably need to read the [ComputerTutorial Computer Tutorial] page. If you already wrote a emulator and want to write your first emulator, check the [EmulatorTutoral Emulator Tutorial].

The [AtariTutorial Atari Tutorial] describes the process of writing a real machine emulator.
